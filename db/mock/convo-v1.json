          "Yeah. I guess there's three quick points I could note. I think that like, I wish that there were more diagrams and visuals. Across, like, the various tech repos and projects. I think that we're also constantly switching to new technology which has its benefits They each kinda provide some new feature or new functionality that improves upon the previous. Just the process of constantly changing to the next and to the next and to the next. Is, um, a lot. For this hackathon, that I'm currently working on, I I really didn't know what to build There's, like, a somewhat set of problems that have been noted. But these seem to be already aggregated by someone else. And doesn't directly point to problems directly experienced by people, and there's not that there could be a better solution to collecting problems and sharing problems throughout the organization."

          "Thank you for sharing that, Ben. It sounds like you have some valuable insights about areas that could definitely use improvement.\n\n1. **Diagrams and Visuals**: You mentioned a desire for more diagrams and visuals in tech repos and projects. Could you elaborate on how the lack of these visuals impacts your work? Are there specific situations where clearer visuals would have made a difference?\n\n2. **Switching Technologies**: The frequent changes in technology can indeed be overwhelming. How does this constant switching affect your workflow or productivity? Do you find it challenging to stay updated, or is it more about the time lost in adapting to these changes?\n\n3. **Hackathon Feedback**: It sounds like you would benefit from a better system for identifying real problems that need addressing, especially for projects like hackathons. What do you think an effective process for collecting and sharing these problems might look like? Have you seen any models or strategies in other teams or organizations that you think could work?\n\nFeel free to dive deeper into any of these points or share additional thoughts!"

          "Thank you for clarifying that, Ben. It makes a lot of sense that visuals would help in understanding code and complex systems, especially when dealing with large amounts of information. \n\n1. **Diagrams and Visuals**: It sounds like having more visuals could significantly enhance comprehension and communication within your team and among different teams. What do you think would motivate or encourage your colleagues to include more diagrams in their work? Would workshops or guidelines help with that?\n\n2. **Centralized Problem Store**: Your idea of a centralized problem store is intriguing! It could serve as a hub for identifying common pain points and generating solutions. What features do you think would be essential for such a system? For example, would you want something that allows people to submit problems, vote on them, or track their status?\n\nFeel free to share more thoughts on these ideas!"

Incentives could definitely play a significant role in promoting the use of diagrams and visuals. \n\nWhat kinds of incentives do you think would be effective? Would recognition, such as highlighting individuals or teams who consistently create helpful visuals, motivate others? Or maybe incorporating visuals into performance evaluations or rewarding contributions in team meetings would work? \n\nAnd regarding the centralized problem store, do you envision any particular ways to incentivize participation there as well? For example, could there be rewards for the most impactful contributions or a system for developers to gain recognition for their feedback? \n\nI\u2019m interested to hear your ideas!"
